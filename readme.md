# account registration
### preface
- It is reccomended that you perform account registration on a desktop computer, but the process for mobile should be very similar.
- On mobile **I recommend using Element Messenger** over using Element X for now, Element Messenger is more stable and has significantly more features (threads, channel discovery, additional settings, etc).
